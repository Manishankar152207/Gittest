	 all of whom are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. They serve on the Court as long as they choose, subject only to impeachment. Each state also has a supreme 
	 court; these courts are all courts of appeals, primarily hearing cases that have already been tried. The federal Supreme Court (“the” Supreme Court) has the final word on interpretation
	  of all laws and of the Constitution itself.
	<h2>NOTES FOR SUPREME COURT</h2>
Supreme Court decisions have a significant impact on public policy and are often extremely controversial. In interpreting the Constitution, the justices of the Supreme Court occasionally 
have deduced legal doctrines that are not clearly stated (or stated at all) in the Constitution.For example, in the famous case of McCulloch versus Maryland (1819), Chief Justice 
John Marshall advanced the opinion, accepted by the Court, that the Constitution implicitly gives the federal government the power to establish a national bank, even though such a 
power is not explicitly granted by the Constitution. </div>
